# Hello
Hi. I'm Marlene. I've recently been pushing myself out of my comfort zone. This started with moving to Seattle a few years ago. At my job, I switched from being an information developer (fancy term for technical writer) to an instructional designer a year ago as a way to develop new skills. Now, I'm stepping up to a bigger challenge of learning to code so I can become a software developer. I know it will be a lot of hard work, but I'm looking forward to seeing where this path leads me.

This journal describes the things I'm learning in Code 102. What to know more about what I'm learning? Find me on GitHub.

## Growth Mindset
A growth mindset means that there is no limit to what I can do if I'm willing to have the right attitude and work hard. 

### Reminders
1. Keep going even when you don't feel like it. You'll be glad you did.
2. Everyone was a beginner at some point. 
3. Don't compare yourself to others. Just make sure you're putting forth your best effort.
