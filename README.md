# Hello
Hi. I'm Marlene. I'm challenging myself to learn to code and become a software developer. I'm looking forward to seeing where this path leads me.

This journal describes the things I'm learning at Code Fellows in Code 102. What to know more about what I'm learning? [Find me on GitHub](https://github.com/marlene-rinker)

## Growth mindset
A growth mindset means that there is no limit to what I can do if I'm willing to have the right attitude and work hard. 

### Reminders to help me stay in a growth mindset
1. Keep going even when you don't feel like it. You'll be glad you did.
2. Everyone was a beginner at some point. 
3. Don't compare yourself to others. Just make sure you're putting forth your best effort.
