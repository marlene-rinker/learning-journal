### Things to consider when designing your website

* Who is the site for?
    * Individuals? Companies?
    * Make up personas based on your target audience and consider them when you have a question about how the site will be used
* Why are people coming to your site?
    * What's their motivation?
    * What are they trying to do? (goal)
    * Figure out their key tasks and motivations
* What information do they need?
* How often will they visit the site?
    * Is it a one-time or rare thing they are trying to do or will they come back often?
    * Will the information need to be updated often?


### Designing your website

* Site map - This is used to organize how you want the information to appear on your website.
    * A card sort can be used to help you create a site map. 
    * Group the information in a way that makes sense for your audience
* Use wireframes to sketch out what your website will look like.
    * Draw on a piece of paper
    * Use tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign
    * Use online tools such as [Go Mockingbird](http:gomockingbird.com) or [Lovely Charts](http:lovelycharts.com)
* Use visual design to organize and prioritize information on your website
    * Visual hierarchy -size, color, and style determine the order in which you see things on the page
    * Grouping similar content
* Navigation should communicate what your site is about and how it is organized
