## Growth mindset
A growth mindset means that there is no limit to what I can do if I'm willing to have the right attitude and work hard. 

### Reminders to help me stay in a growth mindset
1. Keep going even when you don't feel like it. You'll be glad you did.
2. Everyone was a beginner at some point. 
3. Don't compare yourself to others. Just make sure you're putting forth your best effort.
