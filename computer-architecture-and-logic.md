## Computer architecture and logic

[Videos from Code.org](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)

### Four tasks that all computers must perform

* Take **input**

* **Store** information

* **Process** that information

* **Output** the results

Algorithm = a series of commands

### Binary number system
* 9 in binary is 1 0 0 1

    * `(1*8)+(0*4)+(0*2)+(1*1)`
    *   8s 4s 2s 1s

* Text, image, and sound can also be represented with numbers and converted to binary

### Circuits and logic
* inputs and outputs are information
* on/off or 1/0 are electrical signals
* circuits do simple tasks and can be combined to do more complex tasks
* examples are Not, And, and Adders
* circuits process billions of calculations per second
* when circuits are small, electricity doesn't have to travel as far which makes the processing faster

### Hardware and software

* The CPU controls all the other parts of the computer. It receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.
* Binary code is the most basic form of software and it controls all the hardware of the computer.
* Software tells the CPU what to do.
* The operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of the computer.
