## Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

### About JavaScript

* Write JavaScript in plain text like html and css
* Use the `<script>` element to tell the browser it's coming to a script. Use src to tell it where the JavaScript file is located.
* You can also write the JavaScript in the `<script>` element.
* JavaScript uses objects and methods. 

    * document.write('Good afternoon!');
    * document is the object
    * the period is the member operator
    * write('Good afternoon!') is the method
    * 'Good afternoon!' is the parameter
* The placement of the script in the html affects where things happen.
* JavaScript adds interactivity to the page.
* JavaScript is case sensitive.

### Statements and code blocks
* Statements are the instructions for the computer to follow. They start on a new line and end with a semi-colon (;).
* Code blocks are contained in curly braces {code block}.

### Comments
* Use comments to explain what your code does so it's easier to read and understand. 

* `/* this is a comment /*` 

* You can use cmd-/ as a shortcut to turn highlighted text into a comment. 

* You can also use comments to prevent parts of the script from running.

### Variables

* Variables store data that the script needs to do its job.

* You declare a variable and then assign it a value. 

    * `var quantity` - declare a variable 
    * `quantity = 3` - assign a value
* Variables using more than one word are written in camelCase where the first word is all lowercase and any subsequent words have the first letter capitalized with no spaces between the words.

### Data types

* Numbers
* Strings

    * Can use single or double quotes, but starting quotes and ending quotes have to match
* Boolean (true/false)

    * Used when your code can take more than one path
