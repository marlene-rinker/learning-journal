## Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

* Write JavaScript in plain text like html and css
* Use the `<script>` element to tell the browser it's coming to a script. Use src to tell it where the js file is located.
* You can also write the js in the `<script>` element.
* JS uses objects and methods. 

    * document.write('Good afternoon!');
    * document is the object
    * the period is the member operator
    * write('Good afternoon!') is the method
    * 'Good afternoon!' is the parameters
* The placement of the script in the html affects where things happen.
