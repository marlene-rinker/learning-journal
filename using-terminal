# Cheatsheet for using Terminal

Tip: Compare to Finder to see how it is the same, but a more efficient way to manage and navigate through your files.
The terminal has more functionality than Finder. You can create scripts and aliases. 

## Common commands

pwd - find the path of the working directory
ls - get a list of files
cd - change directory
cd .. - goes back one level in the directory
touch - create a new file (touch newfile.txt)
mkdir - create a new directory (mkdir test)
open - open a file (open newfile.txt)
ls -la - get a longer list of files
cat - what's in the file (cat newfile.txt)

Tip: Use tab to autofile in names of directories or files.
