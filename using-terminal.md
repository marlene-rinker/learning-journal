# Cheatsheet for using Terminal

Compare to Finder to see how Terminal is similar, but a more efficient way to manage and navigate through your files.
The terminal has more functionality than Finder. You can create scripts and aliases in Terminal. 

## Common commands

------------ | -------------  | -------------
pwd | find the path of the working directory |
ls | get a list of files |
cd | change directory |
cd .. | goes back one level in the directory |

mkdir | create a new directory | mkdir test
open | open a file | open newfile.txt
