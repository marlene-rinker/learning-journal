# Text editors

## Chosing a text editor
There's no "best" text editor. It's important to choose the right one for you since you'll be using it to write your code.

### What to look for
- Code completion (saves time and reduces errors - Emmet is a shorthand that is useful)
- Syntax highlighting (uses colors to make the text easier to read)
- Themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
- Extensions (to add more functionality)

## Where to find your text editor

### Comes with your computer
Text editors that come with your computer are very basic, for example, Notepad on Windows and TextEdit on Mac. If you use one, make sure you are editing in plain text. There are other options with more bells and whistles that are probably a better choice.


### Third-party options
Most of these are free and have the features mentioned in "What to look for."
- Notepad++ (Windows only)
- TextWrangler/BB Edit (Mac only) - BB Edit isn't free
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** - this seems to be a favorite and is the one we'll use in class (Made by Microsoft)
- Atom - made by GitHub
- Brackets - made by Adobe
- Sublime Text - not free
