## Programming with JavaScript

### JavaScript makes web pages more interactive
1. **Access** content
1. **Modify** content
1. **Program** rules
1. **React** to events

### Writing scripts
* A script is a series of instructions.
* State the goal and then list the steps that need to be completed to achieve it.

    * Define the goal
    * Design the script
    * Code each step

* Create a flowchart of tasks needed to complete a goal
* Break each task down into a sequence of steps
* Computers solve problems programmatically; they follow a series of instructions, one after the other.

### Expressions

* An expression results in a single value.

* There are two types of expressions:

    * just assign a value to a variable `var color = 'red';`
    * use two or more values to return a single value `var area = 4 * 5;`

### Operators
* Expressions rely on operators which allow you to create a single value from one or more values.

* Types of operators:

    * Assignment - assigns a value
    * Arithmetic - performs basic math
    * String - combines two strings
    * Comparison - compares two values and returns true or false
    * Logical - combines expressions and returns true or false

* NaN means 'Not a number' and is usually returned if you try to use arithmetic operators other than + with strings.
* Adding numbers and strings ends up with a string.

### Functions

* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a task.
* Allows you to reuse the function instead of repeating the same set of statements if the task is repeated in the script.
* Declare a function 

    * `function sayHello() {document.write('Hello!');}`
    * `function getArea() {return width * height;}` - arguments can be values or variables
* Call a function

    * `sayHello();`
    * `getArea(3,5);`

* Functions can return a value to the code that called it.
